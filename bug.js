This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a component that is unmounted before the ref's callback is executed.  This commonly happens when navigating away from a screen quickly or when a component is conditionally rendered and removed before the ref's callback has a chance to complete.

```javascript
// Buggy Component
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (myRef.current) {
      // Some async operation using the ref
      myRef.current.someAsyncOperation().then(() => {
        console.log('Operation completed');
      });
    }
    // No cleanup function, leading to potential issues if the component unmounts before the async operation completes
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text ref={myRef}>Some Text</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
